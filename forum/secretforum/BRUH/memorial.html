            This page is a memorial to all the pages that have not been saved.<br>
            The internet archive is trying it's hardest, but undoubtedly even <br>
            they can't save everything. In this site, I hope to re-instill some<br>
            of the personality from the early days of this glorious hell called<br>
            the internet.<br><br><br>
            If you've found this page, I hope you enjoy your stay on my stupid <br>
            site, and I hope you have a great day!
